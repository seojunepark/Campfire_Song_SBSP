# Campfire_Song-SBSP
I call this one, the campfire song song
Let's gather 'round the campfire, and sing our campfire song
Our C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E S-O-N-G song
And if you don't think that we can sing it faster then you're wrong
But it'll help if you just sing along
Bum, bum, buuum
I am forking this song for you to sing
Let's gather 'round the campfire, and sing our forked campfire song 
Our F-O-R-K-E-D-C-A-M-P-F-I-R-E-S-0-N-G song 
And if you don't think we can sing it at all then you are in the wrong
But it'll help if you joined our group and sing this song with each other
Bum, Bum, Buuuuuuuuum
